Space-Jumper
============

My first game made using Cocos2d for iOS. Created summer of 2012 for iOS 6. Made with lots of help from http://www.raywenderlich.com. No longer supported.

Using [UIDevice+Resolutions](https://github.com/c4mprod/UIDevice-Resolutions), [MKStoreKit](https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKStoreKit), and [Cocos2d 2.0](http://cocos2d.org/).
